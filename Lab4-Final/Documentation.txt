For the menu part I have a couple of functions that print basic data like, States, Alphabet, Transitions, q0 and Final States

Checking that the Finite Automata is Deterministic is done by going through all the keys, and looking if there is any list with a length greater than one.

For example, the next representaion is Deterministic:

Q = A B C
E = 0 1
q0 = A
F = A C
S =
	(A,0) => A
	(A,1) => C
	(B,0) => B
   	(C,1) => B


Checking that a sequence is accepted by the Finite Automata is done by going through each symbol from the given sequence and checking that the respective point can be reached
in the corresponding graph.
